* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> GitLab CI/CD supports webhooks
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Can be used to post to Slack, send emails, and more!

Note:

GitLab's CI/CD tooling supports webhooks, which means you can tie into different events.

Maybe you want to post to a Slack channel any time a deployment goes out, or tag a release in your analytics tool. We can script all sorts of extra actions depending on the success or failure of different jobs and stages.
