Note:

It's popular for developers to talk about how we should *never* deploy on Fridays, but that fear feels misplaced.

Continuous delivery means we _can_ deploy any time we want to, because we've automated the process and built in the necessary checks to make sure everything works as we expect.

Still uneasy? Figure out why => good indicator of what needs attention.
